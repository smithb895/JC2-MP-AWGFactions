JC2-MP-AWGFactions
==================

JC2-MP factions module. Written in Lua.

To install this module, create a directory in your <server path>\scripts folder named "AWGFactions".  Then extract the contents of this repo into that folder.  The "server", "client", and "shared" folders should be inside the "AWGFactions" folder.

Then load the module from your server's console using "load awgfactions"

Usage of the mod is explained in the included help script (Which requires Trix's Help Script https://github.com/jc2mp/help ).

This is an early version and I have many more features planned, but wanted to put this out there for people to start using.

Enjoi =)
