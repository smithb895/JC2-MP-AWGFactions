    Title: AWG Factions
    Author: Anzu
    Org: http://www.AnzusWarGames.info
    Version: 0.02
    Description: This factions mod was written from scratch by Anzu, with 
                inspiration coming from the original factions mod written by
                Philpax and the JC2-MP dev team. This script was meant for 
                public use amongst the JC2-MP community. Anyone is free to use
                and modify this as long as they give me credit for the code 
                I've written and don't try to commercialize it. It's a free
                mod after all, right? :) If you want to help code more features
                and fix bugs, please clone it on Github!
