	Description: This factions mod was written from scratch by Anzu, with 
				inspiration coming from the original factions mod written by
				Philpax and the JC2-MP dev team. This script was meant for 
				public use amongst the JC2-MP community. Anyone is free to use
				and modify this as long as they give me credit for the code 
				I've written and don't try to commercialize it. It's a free
				mod after all, right? :) If you want to help code more features
				and fix bugs, please clone it on Github!
